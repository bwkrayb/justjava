This is my attempt at figuring out how to learn Android using a laptop and a desktop at the same time and having the application sync between the computers correctly. 

Now I will need to get git setup with my windows install of Android Studio, and then download the project there. Looks like I can at least manage a push from this laptop. Now I get to learn to pull!
